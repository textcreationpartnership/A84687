            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the carrying on of the great buſineſſes of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> towards a general and happy ſettlement, it hath been a fixed principle with Us, to make it our firſt endeavour with the Parliament, that all things which threaten an Engagement of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in a ſecond War might be removed, before we could
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162344:3"/>have a confident expectation of a good iſſue: which upon a Treaty with their Commiſſioners, which courſe of ours, although it might have ſome appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of delay, yet by men that are zealous of the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> good (we hope) no endeavour will be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unneceſſary, that may ſecure the <hi>Kingdome</hi> from the danger of any new embroylments.</p>
            <p>We are now come thus far, that the moſt material particulars which we have in preparation to propoſe for the generall ſettlement of the affaires of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have been communicated to the Parliament; and we hope they are ſatisfied, that they contain in them things tending to a generall good, and to lay an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Foundation for Common Right and Freedome to the people of this Land for future, and for a laſting peace amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But before we can ſecurely intend, and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption apply our ſelves unto the proceedings and diſpatch of the Treaty, thereupon we have delivered into the hands of the Commiſſioners, the paper which conſiſts of three particulars, in the laſt wherof (which is the <hi>Militia</hi> of the City) you being moſt concerned therein, to the end you may ſee we would ask nothing which relates to you, without giving you a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof, and all poſſible ſatisfaction therein. We ſhould not deſire this, or any thing elſe of that nature, were we not derſwaded, that what we deſire is ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and for yours, and the Kingdomes good and quiet.</p>
            <p>And we ſhould willingly have been ſilent (as to this) but conſidering the juſt jealouſies which lye againſt ſome perſons now authorized in the exerciſe of that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:162344:3"/>power, and thoſe attempts which have been made by ſome, who would have engaged your City to a War, had not your Lordſhip, the Court of Aldermen, and Common councell by your wiſdome prevented it. We cannot in a caſe of this importance, but deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with you, in deſiring your concurrence with ours, &amp;c. And that if the intereſt we have ſo long fought for be ſtill the ſame, let it not ſeem ſtrange that we deſire of the Parliament and City, that thoſe may be in places of Truſt, who have given the beſt proofe of their courage and conſtancy in proſecution of the ſame.

               <p n="1">1 <hi>That there is no juſtice done againſt the Abettors of the late Rebellion, as</hi> Holland, Buckingham, Laughorn, Poyer, <hi>and their Accomplices: or of the Confederates with the Apoſtate Scots: and indeed little Instice by the Parliament done upon any Offenders of that kind. By which we have too much cauſe to fear, that there may be a party in the Parliament abetting and correſpoding with (if not guilty of) the ſame Deſigns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>That notwithſtanding the King hath betrayed the trust repoſed in him, and raiſed war againſt this Nation to inſlave it, violating his Oaths, and trampling under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot our Laws (then which no Engagement now taken can be more binding:) notwithſtanding he is guilty of all the bloud-ſhed in theſe inteſtine wars, as may appear by his own confeſſion in his late agreeing to the Parl. firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: being alſo a perſon who was ſo far concluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to govern, that the Parl. voted that no addreſse ſhould be made to him. There is yet a prevalent party of his Creatures, who in parliament and elſe where, act His Deſign, and are (as we conceive) the Authors of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſtractions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>That through the evill deſignes and practiſes of the foreſaid party, the intollerable burthen of free quarter is continued upon the people notwithstanding the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

               </p>
               <p>We therefore cannot think any thing can be ſafely done in order to a peace, untill ſome ſpeedy and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctnall courſe be taken, which we humbly deſire your Excellency will be pleaſed to your utmoſt power, to endeavour, 1 That there may be a ſtrict ſcrutiny, for the more full diſcovery of ſuch perſons as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers or encouragers of the Rebellions aforeſaid, and that Juſtice ſpeedily be executed on them according to the late Orders of Parliament. 2 That impartiall and ſpeedy Juſtice may be done upon all criminal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and eſpecially upon ſuch as have or ſhal endevor to obſtruct the courſe thereof, or have betrayed their truſt, or bin Authors of ſhedding that innocent bloud, which calls to Heaven for vengeance, that ſo we may be at peace with God. 3 That the ſame fault may have the ſame puniſhment, in the perſon of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> as in the perſon of the pooreſt <hi>Commoner.</hi> 4 That all ſuch may be proceeded againſt as <hi>Traytors,</hi> who act or ſpeak in the Kings behalf, till he ſhall be acquitted of the guilt of ſhedding innocent bloud. 5 That the <hi>Army</hi> may ſpeedily have their pay, or a preſent courſe be taken againſt thoſe who unjuſtly with-hold it; and that they may have the Arrears due ſince <hi>Ian.</hi> 15. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be ordered to pay quarters, and effectuall proviſion made for the payment of former Arreares. 6 That the intollerable oppreſſion of free quarter be immediatly taken off, and that for the time to come whileſt there is neceſſity for an Army, there may be
